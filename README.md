# Phase-field cohesive fracture

FE-code for the paper *[F. Vicentini, J. Heinzmann, P. Carrara, L. De Lorenzis: Variational phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture with flexibly tunable strength surface, JMPS (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2025.106424)*

## Software requirements

This code was built for:

- [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/) v0.9.0
- [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/) >=3.23 (for older versions the bisection line search algorithm is missing)

The easiest way to install everything is with [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda), see the [download page of FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/download/).
To install FEniCSx release 0.9.0, one has to run `conda install -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx=0.9.0 mpich`.

## Usage

All of the codes can be found in `src/`.
The main scripts there are the files `phasefield_cohesive_1D.py` and `phasefield_cohesive_2D.py`.
The other files are:

- `dolfinx_jit_options.json`: JIT configuration for dolfinx
- `model.py`: all model definitions (energy contributions, strain, stress, ...)
- `petsc_interface.py`: classes that manage the interaction with PETSc SNES
- `petsc_options.yaml`: configuration for the PETSc solvers
- `problems.py`: classes containing the setup (mesh, parameters, boundary conditions, reaction force computation, ...) for each of the tests
- `solver.py`: class implementing the alternate minimization algorithm
- `utils.py`: convenience classes and functions for I/O

The 1D implementation can be run as:

```bash
python phasefield_cohesive_1D.py
```

while for the 2D implementation, several more options can be selected, such as the norm for the strength potential, or the target ratio $\ell/\ell_{\text{ch}}$.
For details on the available options, one can run:

```bash
python phasefield_cohesive_2D.py --help
```

The scripts will create the following output files:

- `solution_u.bp`, `solution_α.bp`, `solution_εσ.bp` (optional) and `solution_η.bp`: the resulting fields which can be viewed with [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) (it might be that ParaView has issues correctly displaying the greek symbols; in that case it is advised to replace them in [`src/utils.py`](./src/utils.py) lines 60,86,87 and [`src/phasefield_cohesive_1D.py`](./src/phasefield_cohesive_1D.py) line 92, as well as [`src/phasefield_cohesive_2D.py`](./src/phasefield_cohesive_2D.py) line 156),
- `damage.csv`: the maximum values of $\alpha$ and $\eta$ (or the trace and norm of the deviatoric part thereof) for each load step
- `energies.csv`: the energy contributions for each load step
- `reaction.csv`: the reaction forces for each load step
- `snes_*_convergence.csv`: the residual norms for each Newton iteration of the respective solver
- `staggered_convergence.csv`: the energies, the residual norm of the ($u,\eta$)-problem, the number of Newton iterations and function evaluations as well as the time spent for each staggered iteration
